To compile, run make from the terminal in the directory with the .c files and the makefile.
To run the client, run 
./http_client [-p] (url) (port) 
in the terminal after the code has been compiled.
To run the server, run
./http_server (port)
in the terminal after the code has been compiled.
I did not make the server multi-threaded.
